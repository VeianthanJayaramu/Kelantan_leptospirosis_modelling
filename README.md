Title:

Optimized inputs of Kelantan leptospirosis models and R code to train and test the models

Introduction:

The uploaded data reflect the final inputs (hydrometeorological indices) that were optimized using a relative importance measure called mean decrease Gini (Gini) and a set R code to perform random forest modelling and prediction. These data were prepared under a project called 'Understanding and Managing the Risk of Water-Related Diseases under Hydrometeorological Extremes' funded by the UK (NERC) and Malaysia (Ministry of Higher Education). The study of the uploaded data investigated hydrometeorological indices and their sets in correlating with and classifying the temporal distribution of three Kelantan flood prone districts' leptospirosis occurrence.

Description about the files:
1. Input data: a folder that contains different sets of optimized hydrometeorological indices that represent average, extreme hydrometeorological conditions as well as                  their combination. 'A' indicates average, 'E' indicates extreme, and 'M' indicates mixed (combination of average and extreme). The numbering of files                    indicate the types of indices and their combinations.
2. R code: a folder that contains R codes to perform random forest modelling. Each specific task of the codes has been documented.

Instruction to train and test models:
1. Open the R file.
2. Set working directory.
3. Run each line of codes.
4. Save workspace.

Reminder!
- model running time depends on the computer and model parameters.
- try with a single combination of tunegrid and k value for a quick model run.

The end :)
