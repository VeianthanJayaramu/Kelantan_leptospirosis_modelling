Title: Optimized inputs of Kelantan leptospirosis models and R code to train and test the models

Introduction:
The uploaded data reflect the final inputs (hydrometeorological indices) that were optimized using a relative importance measure called mean decrease Gini (Gini) and a set R code to perform random forest modelling and prediction. These data were prepared under a project called 'Understanding and Managing the Risk of Water-Related Diseases under Hydrometeorological Extremes' funded by the UK (NERC) and Malaysia (Ministry of Higher Education). The study of the uploaded data investigated hydrometeorological indices and their sets in correlating with and classifying the temporal distribution of three Kelantan flood prone districts' leptospirosis occurrence.
